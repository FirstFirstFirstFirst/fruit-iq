description: Default planning workflow for focused, minimal, and precise implementation
---

# Prime Plan

Execute the `Plan` `Implement` and `Test` sections.  
Your goal is to design only the functionality we need right now.

# Plan

- Make a detailed plan to accomplish the task, Think hardest.
- Note that we are in the precustomer phase. Focus only on functionality needed immediately; cut everything else.
- Identify files that need to be changed.
- Exclude legacy fallback unless explicitly required.
- Write a short overview of what you are about to do.

# Implement

- List function names.
- Add 1–3 sentences for each function, describing what it does.
- Map where each function belongs (file, module, or class).

# Test

- Write test names.
- Add 5–10 words describing the behavior each test should cover.
