description: Default planning workflow for focused, minimal, and precise implementation

# Prime Plan

Execute the `Plan`and `Implement` sections.  
Your goal is to design only the functionality we need right now.

# Plan

- Make a detailed plan to accomplish the task. Think hardest.
- Note that we are in the precustomer phase. Focus only on functionality needed immediately; cut everything else.
- Exclude legacy fallback unless explicitly required.
- Write a short overview of what you are about to do.
- Identify files that need to be changed with keyword like remove, add, keep and update

# Implement

[List function names here]

- For each function, provide 1â€“3 sentences describing what it does.
- Specify where the function lives (file, module, or class).
- Ensure each function is mapped to only the files required for the task.
